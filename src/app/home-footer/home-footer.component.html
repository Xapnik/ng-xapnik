      <h4>About Xapnik</h4>
        <p>
        Xapnik's the creation of tech veteran, entpreneur, and coder,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/mspseudolus">Kirsten Lambertsen</a>. It was inspired by the members of an informal group she belongs to in NYC called the Danger
        Ladies, a collection of women in tech and startups who banded together to boost each other's careers and lives. The
        Danger Ladies impact on Lambertsen's life demonstrated to her the power of solidarity even for a small group of like
        minded people. She wanted to make it easier for the Danger Ladies to always be there for each other on social media
        (and eventually in the meat space, too), and so she built Xapnik. </p>
        <p>The events of early 2017 have strengthened Lambertsen's
        belief that small groups of people can make a huge difference in each others lives, even if they're spread out across
        the globe separated by thousands of miles. Her hope is that Xapnik will make a meaningful contribution to the power
        of people when they get together.
